## Question 1 : 
Consider a deck of cards with N different playing cards equally distributed among M suits. For example, a standard deck of card has M=4 suits with N=13cards for each suite. You draw all the cards without putting any back. After the first card, each time you pick a card, you compare it to the previous card. If the suits match, you get a point. Otherwise, you get no point. Please answer the following questions about the value of P (amount of points you get at the end of this process) : 

What is the mean of Pwhen N=26 and M=2 ?
What is the Standard Deviation of P for N=26 and M=2?
What is the mean of Pwhen N=52 and M=4 ?
What is the Standard Deviation of P for N=52 and M=4?
What is the conditional probability that P>12 given that it's P>6when N=26 and M=2 ?
 What is the conditional probability that P>12 given that it's P>6when N=52 and M=4 ?





## Question 2 : 
Consider the following Datasets available in the data folder. In order to understand the data, the link below is provided to understand the data model: 
https://github.com/stanford-policylab/opp/blob/master/data_readme.md

Given the two datasets above, please provide the answer to the following queries with the code: 

The proportion of traffic stops in MT involving male drivers
Factor increase in a traffic stop arrest likelihood in MT from OOS plates
Chi-Squared traffic stop arrest test statistic
The proportion of traffic stops in MT involving speeding violations
Factor increase in traffic stop DUI likelihood in MT over VT:
The average manufacture year of vehicles stopped in MT in 2020
P-value of linear regression:
The difference in the total number of stops that occurred between min and max hours in both MT and VT
The area in sq. km of the largest county in MT
